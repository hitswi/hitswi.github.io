<p>I love her character design as it represents little red riding hood. 
She is best friends with hello kitty, flat, and sweet piano. 
She is living with her mama, papa, grandma, grandpa, and her younger brother Rhythm in Mariland, London, England.
I love her collaboration with other brands, like LizLisa.</p>
